This is a basic ChatBot Project. The bot is trained with a small dataset, consisting on 47 documents and 9 Classes/Intents. We Train an Artificial Neural Network after performing some basic data cleaning methods on the textual data! Once the Neural Network is trained, we then build a basic GUI to interact with the chatbot and the user is able to send a message and the ChatBot responds in a very basic sense!

File Description!
If you are going to train the model, you only need the following three files!
1: intents.json (Contains the textual data)
2: Main.ipynb (Contains the code for cleaning the data and training the Neural Network)
3: gui_load.py (Contains the code for reading the saved files(model, classes and words), building the basic GUI, and then generating the Predictions based on User Inputs)

The following files are generated by the Main.ipynb notebook and can be used to directly test out the ChatBot without Training the neural network!
1: classes.pkl
2: words.pkl
3: chat_bot_tr_model.h5

This project was trained on a small dataset, and the intent was to try out text mining.
I'll work on more complicated datasets, and will share here!
